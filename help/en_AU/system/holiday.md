###Holiday Settings

A facility to determine days where the library is not open for service. Defining these holidays will effect calculation of weekdays that the library is active/open, and fine calculation if fines are implemented. There are two types of holidays that can be defined in this menu:
- Regular days off (Monday till Sunday), and 
- Special holidays (defined by date, month and year).

Clicking the **Holiday setting** button will show the days of the week, and the current setting for days off ( indicated by the checkbox.) To adjust the regular days of the week the library is closed, mark the checkbox(es) and click the **Save settings** button.

To view special holidays already set, click the **Special holiday** button. This will display the list of  special holidays with the day of the week, the start date of the holiday and the holiday description. The usual sorting and edit functions are provided.

To add a special holiday, click the **Add special holiday** buttons and  determine the date, month, year and description of the holiday. In addition, special holidays can also be configured for a range of dates (from the start date until the date of completion of holidays).
