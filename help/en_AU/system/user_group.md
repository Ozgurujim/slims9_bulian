###User groups

A facility to define groups of users. In this you can create groupings of your system users and grant read (Read) or Write (Write) permissions for the Senayan modules. Each user can be placed in more than one group.

Provides the functions of:

- **Group list** (listing existing security groups)
- **Search** (search for a group)
- **Edit** and **Delete** groups
- **Add new groups** (add a group). 

The usual facility to sort the list by clicking on a field name is available.



To add a group click the **Add new group** button, and fill in the information of the new module, namely: 

- *Module name* (the name of the module), 

- *Module path* (path/location of the module), 

- *Module description* (brief description of the module)

  

When the fields are completed, click the **Save** button
