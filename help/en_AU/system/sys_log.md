###System Log

This is a menu to view the recorded events on the Senayan system. Records for each event that are produced show :

* *Time*
* *Location* (module name)
* *Message* (description). Messages that appear in the system logs include who (User/Administrator) conducted what ,and where.

When the SLiMS application is used, it will automatically log the SLiMS work and the log size and load will also increase. 

Therefore, the system log function also contains the facility to **Save logs to file**. This process will save the existing log, and then the logs can be cleared by clicking the **Clear logs** button.
