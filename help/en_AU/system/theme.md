###Theme configuration

Using this form you can select both the OPAC interface and the Admin module interface styles.

 The OPAC appearance is set by selecting one of the available *Public templates* and clicking the **Activate** button. When the theme is activated, you can click the **Customise** button to change a variety of appearance settings which will vary according to the particular theme. When customised changes are made, it is important to click the **Save settings** button before exiting the *Theme configuration* pop-up

The admin. module appearance is controlled in the same fashion as the OPAC appearance.



Additional themes can be created by the SLiMS community, and some may be found at :
