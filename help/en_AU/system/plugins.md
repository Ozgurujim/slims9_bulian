###Plugin list

A facility to display available plugins that have been installed in the SLiMS system, and to **Enable/Disable** them individually. Data displayed is:

* **Plugin** (plugin name)
* **Description** (brief explanation of  what the plugin does, its version, the author, and a link to more details)
* **Enable/Disable** (switch)



<u>Note:</u>

Plugins are small additions which can be selectively installed in SLiMS to provided added functions to the core system. They are placed in the /*plugins*/ directory.
