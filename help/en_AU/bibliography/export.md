<hr>
The “Export Data” menu is used to export cataloguing data from SLiMS, via a file in CSV format, to allow it to be imported into other applications (or to another SLiMS database ). 
You can choose the field separator character, the field enclosing character, the number of records to export, which record to start from, and whether to make the first row consist of the field names.


Generally, the defaults will OK to use unless the target application has special requirements.

The export is initiated by clicking the **Export now**  button.

The resulting file will be named *senayan_biblio_export.csv* and will be saved in your browser's download location.

This process can be understood as a data exchange.
