#### Biblio  Item Export
<hr>
Item export is used to export item data from the SLiMS database via a CSV format file. If this activity is done from a single SLiMS database for use in another SLiMS database, then the item export should be done after the bibliographic data export. 
You must specify the file to contain the data,  and may choose the field separator character, the field enclosing character, the number of records to import, which record to start from, and whether the first record consists of the field names.

Generally, the defaults will OK to use unless the CSV file the target application requires is unusual, in which case you can adjust the settings to change the format of the CSV file as you require.
