#### Z39.50 SRU

<hr>
SRU Copy cataloguing allows us to retrieve the cataloguing data from an SRU server in other libraries. It is similar to Z39.50, but with no need to have YAZ library installed on the SLiMS server.


<hr>
By default SLiMS points to the Library of Congress (http://loc.gov), but other sources can be added at will. 

[ This is done within the SLiMS *sysconfig.inc.php* configuration file, or more preferably within *sysconfig. local.inc.php*, so consult your server administrator].

Librarians simply enter the title, author or ISBN/ISSN of a resource they wish data for, then SLiMS will retrieve the data if it is held in the other library's catalogue. If there is more than one result, then the librarian is able to select the desired title and save it.

For effective searching of Z39.50 it is best to use ISBN/ISSN, because ISBN/ISSN searches will be more accurate.

Here is a list of  [ z39.50 servers](http://irspy.indexdata.com/).

##### Usage:

<hr>
Type the title, author or ISBN. Choose the appropriate result, and save it to the database.
