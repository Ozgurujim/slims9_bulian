#### Item Barcodes Printing
<hr>
The menu provides a means to print barcodes for items that have been included in the SLiMS catalogue.


A search function allows you to search for items by keyword.

Results can be sorted by clicking on the field name at the top of each column. 

- **Select** the items for which you want to print barcodes, by clicking on the title(s) or the checkbox at the side. A checkmark will appear in the box of those selected. 

  When printing consecutive item barcodes, select the first one, hold the Shift key, and select the last title in your group to select more than one in rapid sequence. *Note: one print run can only contain a maximum of 50 records.* 

  

- Click **Add to Print Queue** to enter the selection in the print queue.

- Click **Print Barcodes for Selected Data** to start printing the Selected Data, and it will display a pop-up that asks you to send barcodes to the printer.

- An option exists to **Clear Print Queue** at any stage.
