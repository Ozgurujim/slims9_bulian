#### Label Printing Menu 
<hr>
With this menu you can print labels based on the collection of bibliographic data which is entered in SLiMS. The following sequence prints labels using the Label Printing menu:
- Click **Label Printing**, and a screen with functions will display:

- **Select** the titles for which you want to print labels, by clicking on the title(s) or the checkbox at the side. A checkmark will appear in the box of those selected. 

  When printing consecutive title labels, select the first title, hold Shift key, and select the last title in your selection to select more than one in rapid sequence. *Note: one print run can only contain a maximum of 50 records.* 

  In this Print Label menu, it is possible to print more than one label, depending on how many copies of a title exist.

- Click **Add to Print Queue** to enter a selection in the print queue.

- Click **Print Labels For Selected Data** to start printing the selected data,  and it will display a pop-up that asks you to send labels to the printer.

- An option exists to **Clear Print Queue** at any stage.
