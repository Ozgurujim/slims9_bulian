#### Catalogue Printing
<hr>
This feature can be used to print traditional catalogue cards (Shelf List, Author, Subject, Title). 
The steps for printing are similar to printing a barcode or book label: 

- **Change Print Catalogue Settings** to select which cards are printed:

  * Shelf list card [Show/Hide]

  * Title card [Show/Hide]

  * Author card [Show/Hide]

  * Subject card [Show/Hide]

    Then  click **Save Settings**

- **Select** the titles for which you want to print cards, by clicking on the title(s) or the checkbox at the side. A checkmark will appear in the box of those selected. 

  When printing consecutive title labels, select the first title, hold Shift key, and select the last title in your selection to select more than one in rapid sequence. *Note: one print run can only contain a maximum of 50 records.* 

- **Add** the data to the print queue. 

- **Print** the catalogue cards for the data 

- **Clear** the print queue ( optional).
