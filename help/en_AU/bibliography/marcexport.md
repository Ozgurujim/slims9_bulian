#### MARC EXPORT
<hr>
MARC EXPORT enables SLiMS to export catalogue data in MARC format as a .MRC file for use in other systems. 
- Search for titles to be exported by: ISBN, author, or title, 
- Select the required titles - this must be done by marking individual checkboxes
- Export the data by clicking **ADD TO EXPORT QUEUE**, then **EXPORT NOW**

Additionally, **BATCH EXPORT** allows for bulk records to be exported in *MARC RAW ,  MARCXML* , or  *MARCJSON* format. You may choose how many records to export and the beginning record number.
