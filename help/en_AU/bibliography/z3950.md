#### Z39.50 Service
<hr>
This is a feature that allows library users to import cataloguing data from other libraries. By default SLiMS points to the Library of Congress (http://loc.gov), but other sources can be added at will. Librarians simply enter the title, author or ISBN/ISSN, then SLiMS will retrieve the data. If there is more than one result, then the librarian is able to select the desired title and save it.


For effective searching of Z39.50 it is best to use ISBN/ISSN, because ISBN/ISSN searches will be more accurate.

Here is a list of  [ z39.50 servers](http://irspy.indexdata.com/).

##### Usage:
