#### MARC SRU
<hr>
MARC SRU Copy cataloguing allows SLiMS to directly import catalogue data in MARC format from a MARC SRU server. 
- Search for titles by: ISBN, author, or title, 
- Select the required titles - this must be done by marking individual checkboxes
- Import the data by clicking **SAVE MARC RECORDS TO DATABASE**.


Additional SRU Servers may be configured by editing an appropriate set of lines in *sysconfig.local.inc.php* .
