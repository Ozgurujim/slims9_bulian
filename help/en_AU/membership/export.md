####Export Data

This menu is used to retrieve the membership data within the Senayan application, and the resulting data is then output as a .CSV file.

You can choose the field separator character, the field enclosing character, the number of records to export, which record to start from, and whether to make the first row consist of the field names.

The export is initiated by clicking the **Export now**  button.

The resulting file will be named *senayan_member_export.csv* and will be saved in your browser's download location.
