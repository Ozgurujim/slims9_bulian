####Import Data

<hr>
The “Import Data” menu is used to retrieve member data from outside of SLiMS, via a file in CSV format (or also from a database that has been exported from Senayan to a file in CSV format), and to then include it in Senayan. 
You must specify the file containing the data,  and can choose the field separator character, the field enclosing character, the number of records to import, which record to start from, and whether the first record consists of the field names.

Generally, the defaults will OK to use, unless the CSV file is unusual in format.

The CSV file for importing should usually be in the same format as a standard SLiMS CSV export file, so it is worthwhile studying one of those for format, field names, and field order, if you are importing a CSV from a different application.
