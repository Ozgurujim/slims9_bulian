This provides the facility to add new members to the data in the Senayan system. Members' information included are: 
- *Member ID* (ID -barcode/RFID for the member)
- *Member name* (full name of the member)
- *Birth date* 
- *Register date* (date of registration)
- *Expiry date* (the expiration date)

- *Upload a photo* (photo file of member), or use the camera function [if enabled]. 
- *E-mail* ( email address)
- *Password*  ( & confirmation )

Expiry date contains a checkbox for **Auto Set**. The intent of this facility, is that if the Auto Set is checked, the member's expiry date will then be calculated based on membership type. However, if unchecked, then the expiry date can be determined manually, by selecting the date of expiry.

This form also provides the option **Pending membership**. If Pending membership is checked, then that member will not be able to borrow, although their membership is still active and retained in the database. It can be applied as a sanction against members who break the library rules.
