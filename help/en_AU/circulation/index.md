###Start transaction

This screen allows you to make transactions via the Member ID (ID of member). Once a Member ID is inserted in the request box, it will display the member's information, namely: 
- *Member name* (The name of the member), 
- *Member email* (The member's email address), 
- *Register date* (The date the member registered), 
- *Member ID* (The member's ID ), 
- *Member type* (The type of membership), 
- *Expiry date* (The membership end date), and 
- *Member photo*.  ( If it has been included in the membership record). This allows borrower verification.

Underneath the displayed details there are tabs for functions: 
- **Loans** (to make loan transactions), 
- **Current loans** (a list of the current loans the member has), 
- **Reserve** (to create reservations of titles for future borrowing), 
- **Fines** (fines the borrower has incurred, if the library has a fines policy), 
- **Loan history** ( the history of borrowing undertaken by the member). 

In **Current loans** there are also facilities for returns (**Return**) and to extend lending (**Extend**).
