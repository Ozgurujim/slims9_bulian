This look-up table contains the authoritative list of places of publication used in the catalogue.


##### Place list


This function enables management of the place master-file. It displays the list of places of publication ( e.g Chiang Mai, Thailand ; Brisbane, Australia etc. )  in the lookup table , with data for:



- *Place name* (authoritative geographic name for the place of publication)
- *Last update* (when the record was last edited)

This section is provided with facilities to DELETE  and EDIT place data.

To edit a place , double-click on the label , or single-click on the pencil (edit) icon.

A search function allows you to search for entries by place keywords.

Results can be sorted by clicking on the field name at the top of each column. 

##### Add new place

This provides the facility to add places directly to the data in the Senayan system. Places' information includes the fields listed above, with the exception of *Last updated*, which is done automatically when the **Save** button is clicked.

Adding a place to the master-file can also be done during the cataloguing data input if the place is not found during the place data input for a new title.
