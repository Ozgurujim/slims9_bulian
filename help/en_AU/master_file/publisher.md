####Master File / Publisher
<hr>
This look-up table contains the authoritative list of publishers used in the catalogue.


##### Publisher list


This function enables management of the publisher master-file. It displays the list of publishers ( e.g Penguin , CSIRO Publishing, etc )  in the lookup table , with data for:

- *Publisher name* (authoritative name of the publisher)
- *Last update* (when the record was last edited)

This section is provided with facilities to DELETE  and EDIT publisher data.

To edit a publisher , double-click on the publisher , or single-click on the pencil (edit) icon.

A search function allows you to search for entries by publisher keywords.

Results can be sorted by clicking on the field name at the top of each column. 

##### Add new publisher

This provides the facility to add publishers directly to the data in the Senayan system. Publishers' information includes the fields listed above, with the exception of *Last updated*, which is done automatically when the **Save** button is clicked.

Adding a publisher to the master-file can also be done during the cataloguing data input for a new title if the publisher is not found to exist in the master-file during the publisher data input. In that case, the option to *Add* the publisher will be presented to the cataloguer, so care should be taken to enter data correctly as the name will then be added to the master-file.
