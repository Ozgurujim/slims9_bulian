##### Item status


This enables management of the Item status master file. It displays the list of possible item statuses ( e.g missing, not for loan, repair )  in the SLiMS database , with data for:

- *Item status code* (unique code for the status)
- *Item status name* (description of the status)
- *Last update* (when the record was last edited)

This section is provided with facilities to DELETE  and EDIT item status data.

To edit an status , double-click on the status , or single-click on the pencil (edit) icon.

A search function allows you to search for entries by item status name keywords.

Results can be sorted by clicking on the field name at the top of each column. 

##### Add new item status

This provides the facility to add new item statuses directly to the data in the Senayan system. Item status' information includes the fields listed above, with the exception of *Last updated*, which is done automatically when the **Save** button is clicked.

There are two additional options , to allow you to set Rules for the  new status. 

1. Checking the *No loan transaction* box will prevent items with the new status being loaned (e.g. digital/online collections ). 
2. Checking the *Skipped by stocktake* box will remove items with this new status from the stocktake process.
