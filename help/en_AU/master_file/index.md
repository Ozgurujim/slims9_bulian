#### Master File / GMD
<hr>
In this module we can enter master file data that is used for lookups in cataloguing data entry. 

GMD : General Material Designation â€“ The physical form of the media item . While this was utilised in AACR2 cataloguing, it was superseded in RDA cataloguing by content, media, and carrier terms.

SLiMS retains this functionality for libraries still using AACR2 standards, but libraries should adhere to the standard GMDs.

The layout and function of this section is similar to other master-file entry/management screens.
