####Master File / Label
<hr>
To provide specific information about a catalogued resource,  labels can be defined using the label master-file function. These labels are primarily used to provide visual cues , and potentially hyperlinks, in the SLiMS OPAC.

##### Label list


This function enables management of the label master-file. It displays the list of labels ( e.g New title, favourite title,  multimedia )  in the lookup table , with data for:

- *Label description* (description of the status seen by users)
- *Label name* (unique name for the label, used internally by SLiMS, in the form *label-xyz*)
- *Last update* (when the record was last edited)

This section is provided with facilities to DELETE  and EDIT label data.

To edit a label , double-click on the label , or single-click on the pencil (edit) icon.

A search function allows you to search for entries by label keywords.

Results can be sorted by clicking on the field name at the top of each column. 

##### Add new label

This provides the facility to add labels directly to the data in the Senayan system. Labels' information includes the fields listed above, with the exception of *Last updated*, which is done automatically when the **Save** button is clicked.

Adding or editing a label also provides a *File attachment* facility,  to install a graphic file to act as an icon for the label. The image should be in PNG format.
