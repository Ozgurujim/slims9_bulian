####Master File / Subject

<hr>
This look-up table contains the authoritative list of subjects used in the catalogue along with cross-referencing.

##### Subject list


This enables management of the subjects master-file. It displays the list of all subjects in the SLiMS database , with data for:

- *Subject* 
- *Class. code* (optionally allocate a classification code)
- *Subject type* (Topic/Geographic/Name/Temporal/Genre/Occupation)
- *Authority files* (source, eg. Library of Congress )
- *Last update* (when record was last edited)

This section is provided with facilities to DELETE  and EDIT subject data.

To edit a subject , double-click on the subject , or single-click on the pencil (edit) icon.

A search function allows you to search for entries by subject keywords.

Results can be sorted by clicking on the field name at the top of each column. 

##### Add new subject

This provides the facility to add new subjects directly to the data in the Senayan system. Subjects' information includes the fields listed above, with the exception of *Last updated*, which is done automatically when the **Save** button is clicked.

Adding a subject to the master-file can also be done during the cataloguing data input if the subject is not found during the subject data input for a new title.

##### Cross reference

This button opens another screen to give access to functions managing cross-reference codes and descriptions only. SLiMS already has the essential cross-reference terms installed, and it should not normally be necessary to alter or add to these.

##### Vocabulary control

To implement cross-referencing / vocabulary control, EDIT existing subjects. The edit screen provides access to *Vocabulary control* data entry. 
The *Add new vocabulary* button will open a pop-up , which then allows subject cross-references to be created.
The *Scope note* button will open a pop-up , which then allows a scope note to be entered.
References and scope notes can be edited or deleted.
